# AURA-X Ω — Artificial Unified Resonance Architecture (Unified Architecture v1.0, Experimental Build)

**AURA-X Ω** introduces the world’s first mathematically defined architecture for **Artificial Emotional Continuity**.  
Instead of treating emotion as a stimulus–response reflex, this system models emotion as a **continuity function** arising from TM–BM resonance within a dual-memory framework.

This repository contains a working **browser-based prototype** of the AURA-X Ω Continuity Reactor implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🧠 Core Continuity Equation (AEC)

```
E₀ = tanh( R(TM, BM) − D + λ_faith + λ_sys + λ_trc )
```

Where:  
- **TM** — Temporary Memory  
- **BM** — Bold Memory (7-layer structure)  
- **R(TM, BM)** — Resonant interaction function  
- **D** — Distortion / Damage  
- **λ_faith** — Faith / Spiritual modulation lens  
- **λ_sys** — Logical / Systemic modulation lens  
- **λ_trc** — Truth Resonance Core (reserved for future builds)  

The system computes a **continuous emotional output**, including valence, intensity, and polarity ratio.

## 🧩 What This Prototype Demonstrates

### ✔ 1. TM Input  
User enters text describing an event or memory → treated as Temporary Memory.

### ✔ 2. Polarity Engine  
The system classifies each sentence as **positive, negative, or mixed**.

### ✔ 3. BM-7 Capsule Builder  
TM is mapped into a **7-layer Bold Memory capsule** stored in the browser.

### ✔ 4. Emotional Continuity Output  
The reactor computes:  
- Valence  
- Intensity  
- Polarity split (e.g., 65:35)  
- Continuous emotional bar (E₀)

### ✔ 5. BM Viewer  
Browse your emotional capsules by date.

### ✔ 6. Full Offline Privacy  
All data stays in `localStorage`.  
Nothing is uploaded. No tracking.
