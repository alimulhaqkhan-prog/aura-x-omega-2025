AURA-X Ω — Artificial Unified Resonance Architecture (Unified Architecture v1.0, Experimental Build)

AURA-X Ω introduces the world’s first mathematically defined architecture for Artificial Emotional Continuity.
Instead of treating emotion as a stimulus–response reflex, this system models emotion as a continuity function emerging from TM–BM resonance inside a dual-memory cognitive structure.

This repository contains a working browser-based prototype implemented entirely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

🧠 Grand Continuity Equation (AEC)

E₀ = tanh( R(TM, BM) − D + λ_faith + λ_sys + λ_trc )

Where:

TM — Temporary Memory

BM — Bold Memory (7 computational layers)

R(TM, BM) — Resonance function

D — Distortion / Damage

λ_faith — Spiritual / belief modulation

λ_sys — Logical / systemic modulation

λ_trc — Truth Resonance Core (reserved for future builds)


The prototype computes continuous emotional output including valence, intensity, and polarity ratio.

🧩 What This Prototype Demonstrates

✔ 1. Accepts TM Input

User enters text describing an event → treated as Temporary Memory.

✔ 2. Polarity Engine

Classifier labels each sentence as positive, negative, or mixed.

✔ 3. 7-Layer BM Capsule

TM → saved as a Bold Memory capsule (BM-7) stored in browser localStorage.

✔ 4. Emotional Continuity Output

Computes:

Valence

Intensity

Polarity split

Continuous emotional bar (E₀)


✔ 5. Memory Browser

Browse BM capsules by date with polarity breakdown.

✔ 6. Full Offline Privacy

All computation stays inside browser.
No cloud. No logging. No tracking.
