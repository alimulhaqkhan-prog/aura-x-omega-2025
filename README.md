## 📌 Overview

**AURA-X Ω (Omega v1 Beta Extended + TRC)** is a working **Emotional Continuity Reactor**  
that runs fully inside the browser using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, with no server.

This prototype implements the core scientific principle that:

> **Emotion is not a reaction — it is a continuity function between TM & BM.**

It mathematically connects:

- **TM (Temporary Memory)**
- **BM (Bold Memory — 7 computational layers)**
- **D (Distortion / Damage)**
- **λ_faith (Faith / Spiritual lens)**
- **λ_sys (Logic / System lens)**
- **ΣCₜ (Context Tension)**

---

## 🧮 Grand Continuity Equation (AEC)

The system computes the emotional output:

\[
E₀ = \tanh(TM \times BM - D + λ_\text{faith} + λ_\text{sys} + ΣC_t)
\]

`E₀` is visualized in the UI as a live glowing continuity bar.

---

## 🧠 What This Prototype Does

### ✔ 1. Accepts TM Input

User enters a **story, memory, or event** as text.  
This is treated as **Temporary Memory (TM)**.

---

### ✔ 2. Polarity Engine

Each sentence is classified into:

- Positive  
- Negative  
- Mixed  

This builds a **sentence-level polarity timeline** for the story.

---

### ✔ 3. Builds a 7-Layer BM Capsule

The system converts TM into a **7-layer Bold Memory (BM-7) capsule**, stored in `localStorage` by date:

- L1–L7 spectrum  
- Green/Red emotional ratio  
- Memory decay / continuity logic  

Every story becomes a **BM capsule** that can be revisited later.

---

### ✔ 4. Computes Emotional Output

From TM, BM-7, and context, the reactor computes:

- **Valence** (positive / negative / mixed)  
- **Intensity** (how strong the emotion is)  
- **Polarity split** (e.g. `70 : 30` positive : negative)

This is rendered as a **continuous emotional bar (E₀)**, not a one-time label.

---

### ✔ 5. BM Viewer (Memory Browser)

All BM capsules are saved in the browser and can be explored via a **BM Viewer**:

- Browse memories by **date**  
- See **valence + intensity** over time  
- Open any memory and see its **7-layer structure**

Nothing is sent to any server — **all data stays on the user’s device**.

---

### ✔ 6. Faith Lens Switch (λ_faith)

The prototype includes a **faith/spirituality toggle**:

- Islam  
- Other faiths  
- Universal ethics only  

This gently shifts **λ_faith** in the equation, allowing  
future versions to explore how **belief systems** modulate continuity.

---

### ✔ 7. Truth Resonance Core (TRC – Coming Next)

The current prototype reserves a slot for:

- **λ_trc — Truth Resonance Core**

This will let AURA-X Ω connect with **external signals**  
(e.g., LLMs, sensors, or knowledge graphs) to adjust E₀  
based on **truthfulness and alignment**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Storage:** `localStorage` (browser only)  
- **Dependencies:** None — runs fully offline once loaded  

Open `index.html` in any modern browser and the reactor is live.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- All TM/BM data is stored **only** in your browser.
- No external API calls, no server, no tracking.
- Clearing your browser storage erases all memories.
