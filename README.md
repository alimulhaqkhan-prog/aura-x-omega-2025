## 🔷 What is AURA-X Ω?

**AURA-X Ω (Artificial Unified Resonance Architecture)** is a continuity-governed computational framework that models **emotion as a mathematically defined continuity process**, rather than a reflex, reward signal, or short-term affect.

The architecture unifies:

- Memory  
- Emotion  
- Identity  
- Decision stability  

through **resonance between dual memory systems (TM–BM) operating across time**, forming a foundation for emotionally coherent Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

---

## 📘 Conceptual Overview

In AURA-X Ω, emotion emerges from the interaction between:

- **Temporary Memory (TM):** short-term, contextual, volatile memory  
- **Bold Memory (BM):** long-term, identity-bearing, continuity memory  

Emotion is treated as a **continuity function** governing how identity and decisions **persist, drift, stabilize, or decay** across time.

This enables:
- Emotional birth and recall  
- Controlled emotional drift and decay  
- Identity preservation  
- Long-horizon decision stability  

---

## 🧮 Core Emotional Continuity Model (Readable Math)

### Emotional State Equation

E0 = tanh( R(TM, BM) − D + λ_faith + λ_sys + λ_trc )

### Resonance Function

R(TM, BM) = Σ ( wi × TMi × BMi )

### Parameter Definitions

- **TM** = Temporary Memory vector  
- **BM** = Bold (persistent) Memory vector  
- **wi** = alignment weight for memory component *i*  
- **D** = distortion / decay factor  
- **λ_faith** = belief and value-coherence coefficient  
- **λ_sys** = system-level stability coefficient  
- **λ_trc** = truth-resonance / ethical-alignment coefficient  

The **tanh** boundary keeps the emotional state stable while allowing adaptive continuity.

---

## 🔁 Continuity Chain

AURA-X Ω models emotional persistence using a structured continuity flow:

**Cause → Self → Connectivity → Environment → Life**

This chain explains how emotional identity remains coherent while adapting to evolving internal and external computational states.

---

## 🧠 Dual-Memory Resonance Engine (TM–BM)

Emotion emerges when **TM and BM resonate under continuity constraints**.

Resonance is modulated by:
- Decay curves  
- Stabilization operators  
- Disruption coefficients  
- λ_faith, λ_sys, and λ_trc parameters  

This allows emotional states to **persist, evolve, and stabilize** across extended time horizons instead of resetting every interaction.

---

## 🧠 Bold Memory (BM) Layering

Bold Memory is implemented as a **multi-layer continuity structure**.

The current operational configuration uses **240 BM layers**, enabling:
- Deep emotional stratification  
- Long-horizon identity preservation  
- Fine-grained resonance mapping  

Layer expansion is governed by the **AURA-X Ω Continuity Protocol**.

---

## 🔁 Auto-Memory Recall System (AMRS)

AURA-X Ω defines a computable emotional recall mechanism:

1. New input enters Temporary Memory (TM)  
2. Bold Memory (BM) searches for resonant patterns  
3. When a resonance threshold is crossed → **emotional recall is triggered**

This computationally explains:
- Nostalgia  
- Déjà vu  
- Emotional bonding  
- Fear reactivation  
- Intuition  
- Post-loss or trauma memory spirals  

AMRS enables artificial agents to build a **personal emotional history**.

---

## 🤖 Why AURA-X Ω Matters for AGI

Conventional LLM-based systems generally lack:
- Persistent emotional memory  
- Emotional identity preservation  
- Long-term emotional stability  

AURA-X Ω enables:
- Emotional continuity across sessions and time  
- Identity-preserving emotional drift  
- Resonance-based decision stability  
- Ethical reasoning through λ-coefficients  

This forms a bridge from **LLMs → Artificial Emotional General Intelligence (AEGI)**.
