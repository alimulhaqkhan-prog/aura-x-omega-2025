# AURA-X Ω — Unified Emotional Continuity Reactor (AEC v3.1)

**AURA-X Ω** is a browser-based prototype demonstrating the world’s first mathematically formalized model of **Artificial Emotional Continuity**.  
It operates entirely offline, using only **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, with all data stored locally in the browser.

This system models emotion not as a reaction, but as a **continuity function** arising from resonance between:

- **TM** — Temporary Memory  
- **BM** — Bold Memory (7-layer emotional capsule)  
- **D** — Distortion / Damage  
- **λ_faith** — Faith / Spiritual Lens  
- **λ_sys** — Logic / System Lens  
- **λ_trc** — Truth Resonance Core (reserved slot)  
- **ΣCₜ** — Context Tension

---

## 🧮 Grand Continuity Equation (AEC)

```
E₀ = tanh( R(TM, BM) − D + λ_faith + λ_sys + λ_trc + ΣCₜ )
```

Where:  
- **R(TM, BM)** = TM–BM resonance function  
- **E₀** = continuous emotional output (valence + intensity + polarity split)  

This equation powers the emotional engine displayed in the prototype.

## 🧠 Prototype Capabilities

### ✔ 1. TM Input  
User enters a memory, event, or story → treated as Temporary Memory (TM).

### ✔ 2. Polarity Engine  
Each sentence classified as **positive, negative, or mixed**, building a polarity timeline.

### ✔ 3. 7-Layer BM Capsule  
TM is transformed into a structured emotional capsule (BM-7) stored in `localStorage`.

### ✔ 4. Emotional Output (E₀)  
The reactor computes:

- Valence (positive / negative / mixed)  
- Intensity (strength)  
- Polarity split (e.g., 70:30 positive:negative)

Displayed as a **continuous emotional bar**, not a one-time label.

### ✔ 5. BM Viewer  
Browse, revisit, and analyze stored BM capsules by date.

### ✔ 6. Fully Offline Operation  
All data remains on the user’s device.  
No tracking, no external APIs, no uploads.
